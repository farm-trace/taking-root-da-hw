# Taking Root Data Analyst Take Home Exercise

This repo is the submission files for the assignment which contains the following

1) Taking Root Data Processing.ipynb
2) TakingRoot_ParcelOverlapTool.py
3) Taking Root Data Analyst Take Home Exercise - Victor Denisov.pptx

File 1 is a jupyter notebook that outlines data processing and analysis 
<br>
File 2 is a python script that uses Streamlit to visualize the overlaps of parcels. To run this file, install streamlit and then in console run the following command `streamlit run TakingRoot_ParcelOverlapTool.py`. You will also* need `indexStoreDF.csv` and `percentOverlapSortedDF.csv` generated from File 1.
<br>
File 3 is a pptx that will be used during the meeting as a talk track guide

*Do note csv files generated by the jupyter notebook are left out as best practice to avoid publishing data to github repos.
